## kanban

Web Application based on kanban organization system. It's possible to organize different type of tasks from work, or even personal, through different panels, and in each panel is also possible to inform the status of the tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ Create different dashboards for your different types of tasks.

- 📰 Create specific tasks for each panel.

- 👉 Change the status of each task depending on its progress.

- 🌑 Do you prefer dark mode? Just change it in our sidebar. Oh! and if you prefer to use the tool more broadly, just hide the sidebar. 😉


## ⚙️ Usage


You need to install Node.js and Yarn first, then in order to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/gabrielCesarino/kanban
```
After this run bellow yarn command to install all dependencies

```
yarn install

```

To run it on your machine locally just run

```
yarn dev
```

## Next steps

It's still in development, so bugs are expected and I will work on below features on the future:

- Add Context API to handle all the data globally
- Create an API RESTful with NodeJS as currently it's running only with a useState holding all the data
- Animations: When sidebar is toggled, at the board and task creation
- Fix the bugs I said above
